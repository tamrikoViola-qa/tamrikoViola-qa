- I'm comfortable creating checklists with Miro and have experience with Test Management Systems like Test it and Qase.io.
- I've handled databases like MySQL and PostgreSQL using DBever and PGAdmin.
- I'm familiar with CI/CD tools like GitHub Actions and GitLab, and brokers like Kafka.

I'm a proactive team player with strong problem-solving skills. 
I have a keen eye for detail and a commitment to learning and adapting to new technologies. 
I'm also known for my excellent communication skills, both written and verbal, which I believe are crucial in this role.
